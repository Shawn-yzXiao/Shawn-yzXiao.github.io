								<h3> Problem </h3>
								<p>
									Realtime maritime data is valuable for ship route planning and weather prediction, yet we have no way to collect real-time (update frequency < 20 min) maritime data in a large scope due to the limitation of power efficiency and satellite communication. 
								</p>
								<h3>Proposed solution</h3>
								<p>In order to tackle the problem above, we proposed to design an USV unit that has the functions below: <br />
									1. Real-time collection of sensor data, such as position coordinates, air temperature, seawater temperature, inertial measurement, etc. <br />
									2. Form a mesh network with other USVs, which can send, receive and forward data with other nodes in a certain range via radio antenna. <br />
									3. After receiving the command, it can automatically cruise to the specified coordinates and maintain the position within a certain radius. <br />
									4. Energy self-sufficient, charging through solar panels and hydro generatos
									
								</p>
								<h3>Technical Contribution</h3>
								<p>1. I built the first generation of electrical systems, including autopilot based on ArduRover firmware, ocean environment sensors using Arduino, and mesh network communications based on DigiMesh protocol. 
									<br />2. I also designed the second generation of twin-hull motorboat testing platforms using pink insulation foam, which was 60% lighter, 200% faster and 50% cheaper compared to what was previously being used. 
									<br />3. As a part of my thesis, I worked with another undergrad to integrate all the controls into BeagleBoard. 
								</p>
								<h3>Leadership</h3>
								<p>On behalf of Prof. Alam, I took charge of the new undergraduate apprentices selection of 2022 fall semester. As the project manager of five undergraduates and five graduates, I planned a general work scheme, divided the work with everyoneâ€™s strengths in mind, organized weekly meetings and water tests, and managed group documentation on Notion.
