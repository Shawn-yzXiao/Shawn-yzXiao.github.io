								<p>While intensive computer science projects have equipped me with knowledge of algorithms and software development, research in robotics and electrical engineering improved my ability to apply those techniques to the robotics field. In my first visiting semester at UC Berkeley, I was selected as one of three undergraduate apprentices by Prof. Reza Alam to initiate the research project, Developing Unmanned Surface Vehicles Swarm to Collect Real-time Marine Data. During this project, I built the first generation of electrical systems, including autopilot based on ArduRover firmware, ocean environment sensors using Arduino, and mesh network communications based on DigiMesh protocol. On behalf of PI, I took charge of the new undergraduate apprentices selection this semester. As the project manager of five undergraduates and five graduates, I planned a general work scheme, divided the work with everyoneâ€™s strengths in mind, organized weekly meetings, and managed group documentation on Notion. I also designed the second generation of twin-hull motorboat testing platforms using pink insulation foam, which was 60% lighter, 200% faster and 50% cheaper compared to what was previously being used. As a part of my thesis, I worked with another undergrad to integrate all the controls into BeagleBoard. Seeing our boat loitering in the target position and sending back maritime data through the mesh network as no one has before, I hope our project will help us understand this blue planet better.
